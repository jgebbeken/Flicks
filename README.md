# Project 1 - *Flicks*

**Flicks** is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: **20** hours spent in total

note: I just realized (1/30/2016)that I was pushing changes with my other username instead of my school username that I use only for my university. Not sure how to fix it and I am afraid of breaking my github settings in Xcode.

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie Database.
- [x] Poster images are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.
- [x] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies API.
- [x] User can pull to refresh the movie list.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] User sees an error message when there's a networking error.
- [ ] Movies are displayed using a CollectionView instead of a TableView.
- [x] User can search for a movie.
- [x] All images fade in as they are loading.
- [x] Customize the UI.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] If poster image is not available then a no image placeholder will take its place.
- [x] Uses a UILongPressGestureRecognizer with a 2 second hold to refresh table data in a event the network was previously down.
- [x] Search bar disappears from view if the network is down and will reappear if it's available again.
